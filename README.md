These are the parts of our project: 

## 1st PART
->In this we tried to check the Accuracy and Pression of the different algorithms.

### FILES USED:
    Folder: Filtering_Accuracy_Checking
    -> email-spam-filtering-project.ipynb
    -> completeSpamAssassin.csv

#### STEPS TO RUN OUR PROJECT: 

*	Put the code in Google Collab Cells/Jupyter/kaggle
*	Import the data set that consist of Spam & Non-Spam Emails  
*	Then run each cell one by one It might take some time to run 

## 2nd PART
### FILES USED:
    Folder: Filtering_GUI_SVM_Model
    -> SVM_GUI_Filtering.py
    -> spam.csv

This part we our self-implemented a SVM algorithm and GUI Part was created with the help of Python Library tkinter.

#### STEPS TO RUN OUR PROJECT: 

*   As we know that tkinter is not present in google Collab so we have to run this on our personal system.
*   Make a folder and put code file there and also put data set file in that same folder. If you want to chance the path simply update the path in code file as well.
*   The run the python code. 
*   A box will appear, you have to some the in it and click check button it say weather that is ham or spam.
